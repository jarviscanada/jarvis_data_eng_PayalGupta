  "summary": "I am a Results-driven individual who is passionate about software development. While working in Jarvis I worked on industry-related applications using technologies like Java, SQL, Bash, Maven, Docker, REST API. I have more than two years of experience in the insurance/financial industry as an IT professional, this experience helped me to build an analytical, detail-oriented mindset and also exposed me to the work culture and methodologies followed in large-scale industry. During my Computer Science Engineering degree, I could help a non-profit organization by developing their website that helped them to raise funds, which made me more passionate about this field. Since then I have worked on front-end projects using JavaScript, HTML/CSS as well as back-end projects using Java, Python, and SQL. Due to my curiosity, I learned the latest technologies like Cloud services(AWS and GCP) along with work. Through my passion to help others by improving existing methods and enthusiasm to learn new emerging technologies, I will be a great asset to the team and will also be excited about the new upcoming opportunities."
