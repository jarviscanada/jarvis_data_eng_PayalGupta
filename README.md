# Payal Gupta . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Results-driven individual who is passionate about software development. I have more than 2 years of experience in the insurance/financial industry as a Quality Assurance Analyst, this experience helped me to build an analytical, detail-oriented mindset and also exposed me to the work culture and methodologies followed in large-scale industry. While I was completing my Bachelor in Computer Science Engineering I could help a non-profit organization by developing their website which helped them to raise funds, this made me more passionate about this field. Since then I have worked on front-end projects using JavaScript, HTML/CSS. Due to my curious personality, I kept on learning the latest technologies like Cloud services(AWS and GCP) side by side. While working in Jarvis I worked on the industry-related application using technologies like Java, Maven, Docker, SQL, Bash, REST API. Through my passion to help others by improving existing methods and enthusiasm to learn new emerging technologies, I will be a great asset to the team and will also be excited about the new upcoming opportunities.
