# Payal Gupta . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Results-driven individual who is passionate about software development. While working in Jarvis I worked on industry-related applications using technologies like Java, SQL, Bash, Maven, Docker, REST API. I have more than two years of experience in the insurance/financial industry as an IT professional, this experience helped me to build an analytical, detail-oriented mindset and also exposed me to the work culture and methodologies followed in large-scale industry. During my Computer Science Engineering degree, I could help a non-profit organization by developing their website that helped them to raise funds, which made me more passionate about this field. Since then I have worked on front-end projects using JavaScript, HTML/CSS as well as back-end projects using Java, Python, and SQL. Due to my curiosity, I learned the latest technologies like Cloud services(AWS and GCP) along with work. Through my passion to help others by improving existing methods and enthusiasm to learn new emerging technologies, I will be a great asset to the team and will also be excited about the new upcoming opportunities.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_PayalGupta/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux clustering monitoring agent to monitor, collect and analyze data from host machines in a ten node cluster over a network in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using docker container using bash scripts and crontab to automate the script's execution. Created the SQL queries for analyzing the collected data for better business decisions and resources planning.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_PayalGupta/tree/master/core_java)]:
